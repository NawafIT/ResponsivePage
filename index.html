            <h2>Nawaf AL-jehani!</h2>
            <P>
                As an aspiring technologist and a current student at King Abdulaziz University, I am passionate about
                programming, Android app development, UI/UX, and software engineering. I am pursuing a degree in
                Information Technology, and I have received multiple certificates of excellence from my university for
                my academic performance and achievements.</P>

            <p> recently completed a 2-month stint as an IT Care Analyst at Basamh Trading & Industries Group, where I
                supported the IT department in resolving technical issues and implementing new solutions. I also
                leveraged my skills and knowledge in Android app development and a framework called Jetpack Compose. I
                am always looking to learn and improve my skills, and I am eager to apply them to real-world problems
                and opportunities.
